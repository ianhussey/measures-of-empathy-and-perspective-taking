In total, participation takes about 30-60 minutes.<br>\nYour task is to answer the questions sincerely. Please answer all questions, even if you feel you have answered individual questions more than once. This is especially important for our statistical analysis.<br>\nIf you still have questions, please contact the investigator (Markus Dieterich, markus.dieterich@ruhr-uni-bochum.de).<br>\n<br>\n<em>Voluntariness and Anonymity<\/em><br>\nParticipation in the study is voluntary.

Thus, those project staff members who have knowledge of personal data through direct contact with you are subject to the obligation of confidentiality. Furthermore, the publication of the results of the study will be in anonymous form, i.e. without your data being able to be assigned to your person.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Privacy<\/em><br>\nThe collection of your personal data described above takes place without asking for your name.

After completion of the data evaluation, but no later than 31 October 2023, your ID will be deleted. Your data will then be anonymized. However, as long as the ID exists in the data, you can request the deletion of the data collected from you. To do so, you do not need to tell us your name, just your ID. Please store your personal Prolific-ID carefully so that you can request deletion of your data later if necessary.
